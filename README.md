SVG to React Loader
===================

> A Webpack Loader to turn SVGs into React Components

> **NOTE:** [version
> 0.4.0](https://github.com/jhamlet/svg-react-loader/blob/version-0.4.0/README.md)
> is currently in beta and versions prior to that will no longer be supported.
> After sufficient testing can be completed that will be the latest release.
> Until then you can use the beta by `npm install svg-react-loader@next`.

Summary
-------

A wepack loader allowing for inline usage of a SVG as a React component, or for
composing individual SVGs into larger ones.

Handles namespaced attributes (xlink), and other non-react attributes/tags, on
component mounting, so the returned `jsx` will compile cleanly with `babel`.


Installation
------------

~~~
% npm install svg-react-loader
~~~


Usage
-----

~~~js
var React = require('react');
var Icon = require('babel!svg-react!../svg/my-icon.svg?name=Icon');

module.exports = React.createClass({
    render () {
        return <Icon className='normal' />;
    }
});
~~~


Documentation

### Query Params

Query params can be used on the loader path, or on the resource's path. Those on
the resource will override those given for the loader.

`name`: `displayName` to use for the compiled component. Defaults to using the
resource's file name, capitalized and camelCased. ex. `"?name=MyIcon"`

`tag`: Override the root-level tag. If given, will blow-away any attributes
given for the tag. ex.: `"?tag=symbol"`

`attrs`: Attributes to apply to the root-level tag. If a certain attribute is
already assigned to the tag, the value here will override that. ex.:
`"?attrs={className: 'mySymbol'}"`

`reactDom`: A string to require an alternaitve 'react-dom' module. ex.:
`?reactDom=react`

`root`: A pipe delimited list of possible root XML nodes to use instead of the one found in the source file. ex.:
`?root=path|polygon`


Dependencies
------------

As of **svg-react-loader@0.3.2** it no longer specifies any `peerDependencies`.
It is left up to individual users to configure their local **webpack**
installation to support this loader.

**svg-react-loader** requires the following dependencies:

~~~
react
react-dom
babel-loader
babel-core
babel-preset-es2015
babel-preset-react
~~~

> NOTE: you can review the `devDependences` of the
> [package.json](./package.json) file for specific version numbers.

The following cover specific dependencies and how to configure your webpack
installation fro them.

### Babel

As of `babel@6.0` you must specify your
[`presets`](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#presets) to get this to work with
`React`.

Presets can be specified as part of a [Babel
config](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/) as outlined in [Setting up Babel
6](https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/10/31/setting-up-babel-6), or you may specify
Babel presets for your loader within your webpack configuration:

~~~js
// file: webpack.config.js
module.exports = {

    loaders: [
        { test: /\.svg$/, loader: 'babel?presets[]=es2015,presets[]=react!svg-react' }
    ],

}
~~~


### React Before Version 0.14.0

As of `React@0.14.0` the DOM methods have been moved into its own library
`react-dom`.

**svg-react-loader** requires this library to find the rendered component and
update its namespaced xml attributes (and some other things).

If you do not want to install `react-dom` alongside your deprecated version of
`react`, you can work-around this by creating an alias to `react-dom` in your
webpack configuration that points to your installed version of `react`:

~~~js
// file: webpack.config.js
module.exports = {

    loaders: [
        { test: /\.svg$/, loader: 'babel!svg-react' }
    ],

    // ...

    resolve: {
        alias: {
            'react-dom': __dirname + '/node_modules/react'
        }
    },

    // ...
}
~~~

Or, you can pass the correct module name to load with the [query
params](#query-params).
